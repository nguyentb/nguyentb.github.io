I'm currently a Research Associate at [Data Science Institute, Imperial College London, United Kingdom](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/).

My research interests are including, but not limited to, Blockchain Technology, Personal Data Management, Security, Privacy and Trust in the Internet of Things. Research collaboration is greatly appreciated, particularly on Blockchain-related topics. I can be reached anytime at [N.TRUONG Imperial College Email](mailto:n.truong@imperial.ac.uk?subject=[Research%20Collaboration]Inquiry%20From%20Academic%20Webpage). My publication can be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mj4CTOgAAAAJ&hl=en).

Prior to the current position, I received my Ph.D. and Master degrees from [Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU), United Kingdom](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/) and [Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Korea](http://postech.ac.kr/eng/) in 2018 and 2012, respectively.

Regarding to industry experience, I was a Software Engineer at [DASAN Networks](http://www.dasannetworks.com/en/), a leading company on Networking Products and Services in Korea from 2012 to 2015, working on the design and development of the *IEEE 802.11ac* *MAC* protocols. I was also working as a full-stack software developer at [Toshiba Software in Hanoi, Vietnam](http://www.toshiba-tsdv.com/) from 2008 to 2009.
