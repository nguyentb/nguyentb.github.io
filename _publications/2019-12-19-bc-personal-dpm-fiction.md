The  emerging  blockchain  technology  has  enabledvarious  decentralised  applications  in  a  trustless  environmentwithout  relying  on  a  trusted  intermediary.  It  is  expected  as  apromising solution to tackle sophisticated challenges on personaldata  management,  thanks  to  its  advanced  features  such  as  im-mutability,  decentralisation  and  transparency.  Although  certainapproaches  have  been  proposed  to  address  technical  difficultiesin personal data management; most of them only provided pre-liminary  methodological  exploration.  Alarmingly,  when  utilisingBlockchain  for  developing  a  personal  data  management  system,fictions  have  occurred  in  existing  approaches  and  been  promul-gated  in  the  literature.  Such  fictions  are  theoretically  doable;however, by thoroughly breaking down consensus protocols andtransaction  validation  processes,  we  clarify  that  such  existingapproaches  are  either  impractical  or  highly  inefficient  due  tothe  natural  limitations  of  the  blockchain  and  Smart  Contractstechnologies. This encourages us to propose a feasible solution inwhich  such  fictions  are  reduced  by  designing  a  novel  systemarchitecture   with   a   blockchain-based   “proof   of   permission”protocol.  We  demonstrate  the  feasibility  and  efficiency  of  theproposed models by implementing a clinical data sharing servicebuilt  on  top  of  a  public  blockchain  platform.  We  believe  thatour research resolves existing ambiguity and take a step furtheron  providing  a  practically  feasible  solution  for  decentralisedpersonal  data  management.
